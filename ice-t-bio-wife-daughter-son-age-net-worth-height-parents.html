recognized worldwide.</span></p><p><span>Ice-T has managed to carve out his own brand of lyric that paints a picture of street life and violence, things that have heavily shaped and influenced the gangster rap genre.&nbsp;He has since pursued an acting career, appearing as a recurring cast member on the series&nbsp;</span><span>Law & Order: Task Force Victims</span><span>&nbsp;since 2000.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ice-T Bio (age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ice-T was born on February 16, 1958 in Newark, New Jersey.&nbsp;He lost his parents at a young age, which meant he had to live with relatives.&nbsp;He first stayed with a nearby aunt before moving to View Park-Windsor Hills, an upper-middle-class black neighborhood in South Los Angeles to stay with another relative.&nbsp;He shared a room with his cousin Earl, who was a fan of rock music.&nbsp;It is said that Earl’s constant listening to local rock radio stations sparked Ice-T’s interest in heavy metal music.</span></p><p><span>Ice attended Palms Junior High and then Crenshaw High School.&nbsp;Despite the large presence of gangs in his high school, the teenager did not smoke, use drugs, drink alcohol, and was not a gang member.&nbsp;However, he was later linked to the Crips.</span></p><p><span>Tracy enjoyed reading Iceberg Slim’s novels, which he memorized and recited to his friends.&nbsp;The story goes that his friends enjoyed hearing the excerpts and said to him, “Yo, kick some more of that through Ice, T,” giving him his popular nickname.</span></p><h3><strong><span>career</span></strong></h3><p><span>Tracy began his career as a disc jockey and took the Ice-T name as a tribute to Iceberg Slim.&nbsp;While performing as a DJ, he received more recognition for his rap skills and decided to pursue a rap career.&nbsp;In 1987 he released his debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Rhyme Pays</span><span>&nbsp;, which was certified Gold by the RIAA.&nbsp;His second album,&nbsp;</span><span>The Iceberg / Free Speech… Watch What You Say</span><span>&nbsp;, was released in 1988 and earned him his second gold record and rave reviews.</span></p><p><span>In 1991 the&nbsp;</span><span>OG Original Gangster</span><span>&nbsp;appeared ;&nbsp;an album that defined gangster rap.&nbsp;On the album, he introduced his heavy metal band Body Count on a track of the same name.&nbsp;Their first album,&nbsp;</span><span>Counting the Dead</span><span>&nbsp;was released in March 1992.&nbsp;Through his own label, Rhyme Syndicate, Ice-T has released solo and band albums, the most recent being 2017’s Body Count album&nbsp;</span><span>Blutrausch</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>He made his film debut in the 1984 film&nbsp;</span><span>Breaking</span><span>&nbsp;In And Its 1985 Sequel&nbsp;</span><span>Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Over the years, Ice-T has also acted in films alongside Denzel Washington and John Lithgow.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – wife, daughter, son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ice-T is married to Nicole Natalie Marrow (née Austin) better known

became a calendar model around the age of 18, specializing in lingerie, swimsuits and body models.&nbsp;Notably, she was the first Caucasian to be featured on the cover of Smooth Magazine.&nbsp;After that, she appeared in more than 50 magazines.</span></p><p><span>Coco eventually created her own quarterly magazine called “R-Rated” and appeared in low budget films, TV series, talk shows and reality shows.&nbsp;Her most notable appearances are on&nbsp;</span><span>Law & Order: Task Force Victims</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Celebrity Family Feud</span><span>&nbsp;,

grew up while her parents attended high school.&nbsp;His next child is a son named Tracy Marrow Jr. who was born in 1992 from his relationship with second girlfriend Darlene Ortiz.&nbsp;In January 2002, Ice-T married CoCo and a few years later, on November 28, 2015, they announced the birth of their daughter, Chanel Nicole
